abstract = {In this paper we describe our method for the ISIC 2019 Skin Lesion Classification Challenge. The challenge's goal is to classify skin lesions based on dermoscopic images. A diverse dataset of 25 000 images was provided for training, containing images from eight classes. The final test set contains an additional, unknown class. We address this challenging problem with a simple, data driven approach by including external data with skin lesions types that are not present in the training set. Furthermore , multi-class skin lesion classification comes with the problem of severe class imbalance. We try to overcome this problem using loss balancing. Also, the dataset contains images with very different resolutions. We take care of this property by considering different model input resolutions and different cropping strategies. We aggregate all our models with an ensembling strategy where we search for the optimal subset of models. Our final ensemble achieves a balanced accuracy of 70 ± 5 {\%} using five-fold cross-validation.},

abstract = {This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6{\%} of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4{\%} of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6{\%}), prostate cancer (7.1{\%}), and colorectal cancer (6.1{\%}) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2{\%}), stomach cancer (8.2{\%}), and liver cancer (8.2{\%}) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

Early detection and proper treatments for malignant skin cancer cases are vital to ensure high survival rate in patients. We present a novel deep learning based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for generating compatible models on mobile platforms such as Android and iOS. The proposed model was tested on the grand challenge PHDB melanoma dataset. The best performing proposed model excels in the following ways: (1) it outperforms the baseline model in terms of accuracy by 1{\%}; (2) it consists of 60{\%} fewer parameters compared to the base model and thereby it is more efficient on mobile platforms. Furthermore, the model is more compact and retains high accuracy without the need to be downsized; (3) in conjunction with advanced regularization techniques such as dropout and data augmentation, the proposed CNN model excelled when implemented on state-of-the-art frameworks such as Keras and TensorFlow. Additionally, we were able to successfully deploy it on the iOS and Android mobile systems. The proposed model could also be lucrative towards other datasets for image classification on mobile platform},

abstract = {Deep CNN techniques have dramatically become the state of the art in image classification. However, applying high-capacity Deep CNN in medical image analysis has been impeded because of scarcity of labeled data. This study has two primary contributions: first, we propose a classification model to improve performance of classification of skin lesion using Deep CNN and Data Augmentation. Second, we demonstrate the use of image data augmentation for overcoming the problem of data limitation and examine the influence of different number of augmented samples on the performance of different classifiers. The proposed classification system is evaluated using the largest public skin lesion testing dataset, containing 600 testing images, and 6,162 training images. New state-of-the-art performance result is archived with AUC (89.2{\%} vs. 87.4{\%}), AP (73.9{\%} vs. 71.5{\%}), and ACC (89.0{\%} vs. 87.2{\%}). In additional, we explore the influence of each image augmentation on the three classifiers and observe that performance of each classifier is influenced differently by each augmentation and has better results comparing with traditional methods. Thus, it is suggested that the performance of skin cancer classification and medial image classification could be improved further by applying data augmentation.},

With the release of a large public dataset by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration in 2016, development of open-source software for convolutional neural networks, and the availability of inexpensive graphics processing units, dermoscopy image analysis has recently become a very active research field.

Machines (computers) learn to detect patterns not decipherable using biostatistics by processing massive datasets (big data) through layered mathematical models (algorithms). Correcting algorithm mistakes (training) adds to AI predictive model confidence. AI is being successfully applied for image analysis in radiology, pathology, and dermatology, with diagnostic speed exceeding, and accuracy paralleling, medical experts. While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100{\%}, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records.

abstract = {BACKGROUND State-of-the-art classifiers based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were shown to classify images of skin cancer on par with dermatologists and could enable lifesaving and fast diagnoses, even outside the hospital via installation of apps on mobile devices. To our knowledge, at present there is no review of the current work in this research area. OBJECTIVE This study presents the first systematic review of the state-of-the-art research on classifying skin lesions with CNNs. We limit our review to skin lesion classifiers. In particular, methods that apply a CNN only for segmentation or for the classification of dermoscopic patterns are not considered here. Furthermore, this study discusses why the comparability of the presented procedures is very difficult and which challenges must be addressed in the future. METHODS We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases for systematic reviews and original research articles published in English. Only papers that reported sufficient scientific proceedings are included in this review. RESULTS We found 13 papers that classified skin lesions using CNNs. In principle, classification methods can be differentiated according to three principles. Approaches that use a CNN already trained by means of another large dataset and then optimize its parameters to the classification of skin lesions are the most common ones used and they display the best performance with the currently available limited datasets. CONCLUSIONS CNNs display a high performance as state-of-the-art skin lesion classifiers. Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare different classification methods because some approaches use nonpublic datasets for training and/or testing, thereby making reproducibility difficult. Future publications should use publicly available benchmarks and fully disclose methods used for training to allow comparability.},

abstract = {Confirming a diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma requires obtaining a skin biopsy specimen. However, obtaining numerous biopsy specimens - which often happens in patients with increased melanoma risk - is associated with significant cost and morbidity. While some melanomas are easily recognized by the naked eye, many can be difficult to distinguish from nevi, and therefore there is a need and opportunity to develop new technologies that can facilitate clinical examination and melanoma diagnosis. In part I of this 2-part continuing medical education article, we will review the practical applications of emerging technologies for noninvasive melanoma diagnosis, including mobile (smartphone) applications, multispectral imaging (ie, MoleMate and MelaFind), and electrical impedance spectroscopy (Nevisense).},
